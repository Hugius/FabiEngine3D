# Theoretical Framework
- **C++**: a powerful and fast programming language used a lot in game development.
- **OpenGL**: a 3D graphics library.
- **SDL2**: a multimedia library that supports things like rendering, asset loading, input, etc.
- **Translation**: this word is equal to "movement".
- **Scaling**: this word is equal to "size".
- **Transformation**: the combination of translation, rotation, scaling.
- **Collision**: intersection between 2 things (for example: between the camera and a model).
- **Raycasting**: the process of "shooting" a ray from the camera position towards where the camera is looking.
- **Wireframe**: the "skeleton" of a mesh; the drawing of only the lines between vertices.
- **Mesh**: a collection of vertices that make a 3D shape together. Consists of triangles.
- **Model**: a complex 3D object in 3D space, constisting of a mesh.

- **Billboard**: a 2D quad in 3D space.  
![billboard](../images/billboard.png)
- **AABB**: Axis Aligned Bounding Box, a 3D box used for collision.  
![aabb](../images/aabb.png)
- **LOD model**: Level Of Detail model, a less-detailed version of a model.  
![lod](../images/lod.png)
- **Ambient lighting**: the overall lightness of a scene.  
![ambient_lighting](../images/ambient_light.png)
- **Directional lighting**: diffuse lighting based on a directional light source (example: the sun).  
![directional_lighting](../images/directional_light.png)
- **Point lighting**: individual light casters that show light around them (example: a torch).  
![point_lighting](../images/point_light.png)
- **Spot lighting**: a spot light casted from the camera position towards where the camera is looking (example: a flashlight).  
![spot_lighting](../images/spot_light.png)
- **Specular lighting**: specular lighting is a light reflection from any light caster.  
![specular_lighting](../images/specular_light.png)
- **Depth Of Field**: Abbreviated as "DOF", a post-processing effect that blurs all non-focused pixels.  
![dof](../images/dof.png)
- **Fog**: the whole scene can have a foggy effect.  
![fog](../images/fog.png)
- **Shadows**: models can be shadowed for a more realistic scene.  
![shadows](../images/shadows.png)
- **Motion blur**: pixels will be blurred in the first person camera direction of motion.  
![motion_blur](../images/motion_blur.png)
- **Sky HDR**: an effect that effects the brightness of the sky based on the camera pitch angle.  
![sky_hdr](../images/sky_hdr.png)
- **Diffuse mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a model.  
![diffuse_mapping](../images/diffuse_mapping.png)
- **Light mapping**: using a texture to make parts of a model brighter.  
![light_mapping](../images/light_mapping.png)
- **Reflection mapping**: using a texture to make parts of a model reflective.  
![reflection_mapping](../images/reflection_mapping.png)
- **Normal mapping**: using a texture to improve lighting effects on a model.  
![normal_mapping](../images/normal_mapping.png)
- **Height mapping**: using a grayscale texture to generate a terrain.  
![height_mapping](../images/height_mapping.png)
- **Blend mapping**: using a texture to blend multiple textures onto a terrain.  
![blend_mapping](../images/blend_mapping.png)
- **DUDV mapping**: using a texture to distort the texture of a water surface (example: water ripples).  
![dudv_mapping](../images/dudv_mapping.png)
- **Displacement mapping**: using a texture to create waves in the water surface mesh.  
![displacement_mapping](../images/displacement_mapping.png)
- **Flare mapping**: using a texture to achieve a lens flare effect when the camera is looking at a directional lighting caster.  
![flare_mapping](../images/flare_mapping.png)
- **Cube mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a 3D cube map.  
![cube_mapping](../images/cube_mapping.png)
- **Billboard mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a billboard.  
![billboard_mapping](../images/billboard_mapping.png)
- **Image mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a GUI image.
